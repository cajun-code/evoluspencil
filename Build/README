The build process of Pencil is for Linux only (at least for the time being). This means that you can build Pencil only if you are using a Linux machine. However the build outputs are for both XPI, Linux and Win32.

The Win32 installer is built using NSIS. The only requirement for building the Win32 installer is makensis.

For Fedora system, to install makensis:

#yum install mingw32-nsis
